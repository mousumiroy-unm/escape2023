## Installation
Programming will be done within the Jupyter-Lab environment. This can be installed through conda (https://www.anaconda.com/).

To ensure your conda environment has all the packages needed for this course:
1) Download the escape2023.yml file (for example by cloning this repository)
2) Open an anaconda prompt, use 'cd' to move to the directory where this file is located, and then run `conda env create -f escape2023.yml`

Feel free to run the code for this course on your own laptop, but we will be working in the Northrop hall computer lab so you can use those computers if you prefer.
